## creating fish skins from photos
A fish texture and normal map are required for rendering. These two files can be created from a photo with a flat colored background using **scanner** in the `./scanner` subdirectory of this repo. 
Check out its readme. 

## build & run the scene
See your creations in action with **sea**. Have a look at `./sea/README.md` to get it running.
